# Setup guide

Step-by-step setup for `brightspace-mcp`. If your school uses Microsoft Azure AD or Google Workspace SSO, also read [presets.md](./presets.md).

## Step 0 (optional): Non-interactive setup for CI/scripts

If you're in a CI pipeline or DevContainer with no TTY, use `init` instead of `setup`:

```bash
npx brightspace-mcp@latest init \
  --base-url https://yourschool.brightspace.com \
  --strategy browser \
  --preset microsoft \
  --username-ref env:BRIGHTSPACE_USERNAME \
  --password-ref env:BRIGHTSPACE_PASSWORD \
  --tz America/Bogota \
  --locale es-419
```

Run `npx brightspace-mcp@latest init --help` to see all flags and strategy-specific options.

## Step 1 — Install

```bash
npm install -g brightspace-mcp     # global
# or
npx brightspace-mcp@latest setup   # one-shot, no install
```

Requires Node ≥ 20.

## Step 2 — Find your Brightspace base URL

Open Brightspace in a browser. The URL bar shows something like:
- `https://learn.example.edu/d2l/home/...` → base URL is `https://learn.example.edu`
- `https://learn.school.edu/d2l/home/...` → base URL is `https://learn.school.edu`

⚠️ **Do not** leave `https://school.brightspace.com` as the default — it's a placeholder. The server will fail at startup with `version discovery failed` if it's wrong.

## Step 3 — Choose your auth strategy

Four setup paths (use `init` from Step 0 if you're in CI/scripts with no TTY):

### A. Interactive wizard (typed credentials)

```bash
npx brightspace-mcp@latest setup
```

Walks through base URL, auth strategy, credentials, MFA, timezone, and display language — then writes `~/.brightspace-mcp/config.yaml` with mode 0600. Prompts appear in your system language automatically.

### B. Recorder (you log in manually, we steal the cookie)

```bash
npx brightspace-mcp@latest record-auth --save-to keychain
```

Opens a real browser. You log in however your tenant requires — TOTP, push notification, biometric, Yubikey, anything. As soon as you reach `/d2l/home`, the recorder captures your session cookies and writes them into the config under the `session_cookie` strategy.

This is the **only viable path** for tenants with auth flows that cannot be scripted (Microsoft Authenticator number-matching, FIDO2/Yubikey, fingerprint, etc.). Cookie expires in ~1 hour — re-run when auth fails.

### C. Manual YAML

If you know what you need, edit the YAML directly. See [auth-strategies.md](./auth-strategies.md).

**TL;DR for picking a strategy**:
- Admin gave you a Valence API token → `api_token`
- Email/password + TOTP authenticator (scriptable MFA) → `browser`
- Email/password, no MFA, server-rendered form → `headless`
- Tenant has OAuth client registration → `oauth`
- Anything else (biometric, push, USB key, complex SSO) → use **option B (`record-auth`)**

## Step 4 — Verify auth works

```bash
npx brightspace-mcp@latest auth --test
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Authenticated as Jane Doe
✓ D2L API versions discovered: lp=1.59, le=1.93
✓ Session expires in 60 min
```

If this fails, see [troubleshooting.md](./troubleshooting.md).

## Output: timezone and language

The server formats every response in your chosen timezone and language.

```yaml
output:
  tz: America/Bogota       # IANA name; default: detected from system
  locale: es-419           # en-US | es-419 | pt-BR | fr-CA; default: detected
  format: markdown         # markdown (default) | plain
  include_meta_footer: true
```

The setup wizard prompts for both. To change later, edit
`~/.brightspace-mcp/config.yaml` directly.

### Locales

| Locale | Language |
|---|---|
| `en-US` | English (US) |
| `es-419` | Español (Latinoamérica) |
| `pt-BR` | Português (Brasil) |
| `fr-CA` | Français (Canada) |

To add a new locale, PR a `<locale>.json` to
`src/shared-kernel/output/i18n/catalogs/`. The parity test will show missing keys.

## Step 5 — Wire it into your MCP client

See [clients.md](./clients.md) for Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Code.

Quick test from any client:

> *"List my Brightspace courses."*

Should invoke `list_my_courses` and return your enrollments.

## Configuration file location

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `~/.brightspace-mcp/config.yaml` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.brightspace-mcp\config.yaml` |

Override with `BRIGHTSPACE_CONFIG=/path/to/config.yaml` or `--config /path/...`.

## Multiple profiles

You can keep multiple Brightspace tenants in one file:

```yaml
default_profile: undergrad

profiles:
  undergrad:
    base_url: https://learn.school.edu
    auth: { ... }
  research:
    base_url: https://researchportal.school.edu
    auth: { ... }
```

Switch the default with `npx brightspace-mcp@latest profile use <name>` (persisted in YAML), or per-invocation with `BRIGHTSPACE_PROFILE=research npx brightspace-mcp@latest serve`.

List defined profiles with `npx brightspace-mcp@latest profile list` (or just `npx brightspace-mcp@latest profile`).

## What the wizard skips that you may need

The setup wizard covers 80% of cases. For the remaining 20%, edit the YAML manually:

- **Custom Microsoft AAD selectors** → see [presets.md](./presets.md#microsoft-azure-ad-with-authenticator-app)
- **Redis-backed session cache** → set `session.cache_backend: redis` and `redis.url`
- **Write operations** → set `writes.enabled: true` *and* pass `--enable-writes` to `serve`. See [writes.md](./writes.md).
- **Fallback auth chains** → `auth.fallbacks: [api_token, browser]` to try multiple strategies in order

## Common setup checkpoints

The fastest way to verify everything: run **`npx brightspace-mcp@latest doctor`**.

```
$ brightspace-mcp doctor
✓ Config file (/Users/you/.brightspace-mcp/config.yaml)
✓ Config validates (1 profile(s))
✓ Profile resolves (myschool → https://learn.school.edu)
✓ D2L API versions discovered (lp=1.59, le=1.93)
✓ Authentication (Jane Doe, source: browser)
✓ list_my_courses smoke read (12 course(s) enrolled)
✓ Writes gate (enabled)

All checks passed.
```

A red `✗` includes the next-action hint. Manually:

✅ `npx brightspace-mcp@latest config show` prints config (secrets redacted) without errors.
✅ `npx brightspace-mcp@latest config validate` exits 0.
✅ `npx brightspace-mcp@latest auth --test` shows your name and API versions.
✅ `npx brightspace-mcp@latest serve` starts and prints `Discovered D2L API versions ...` to stderr.

If `doctor` is green, you're done. Move on to [clients.md](./clients.md).

## Web UI dashboard

Once configured, launch the terminal dashboard:

```bash
npx brightspace-mcp@latest tui         # full-screen terminal dashboard
```

The dashboard shows upcoming due dates, grades, announcements, and calendar events across all your active courses. Use the Config tab to edit your profile — either field-by-field with guided dropdowns or by editing the file shown there in your own editor (the TUI validates it). Cache stats, audit logs, and diagnostics are also available.
