## Why brightspace-mcp?

D2L Brightspace doesn't ship with a friendly API for daily student / TA workflows. This MCP server bridges that gap so an LLM agent can:

- **Read** your courses, syllabus, content, announcements, grades, quizzes, and discussions
- **Write** carefully — submit assignments, reply to discussions — only when you opt in
- **Adapt** to any institution via YAML profiles and auth presets, no code changes
- **Browse** content via stable `brightspace://` MCP Resources and pre-built prompt templates
- **Manage** everything from a terminal dashboard (`brightspace-mcp tui`)

It's a portable alternative to scripting against Valence by hand — it tells you when it's outdated (and when a security update is due), with SemVer stability from v1.0.0 onward.
